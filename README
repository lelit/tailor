About
=====

Tailor is a tool to migrate changesets between ArX_, Bazaar_, `Bazaar-NG`_,
CVS_, Codeville_, Darcs_, Git_, Mercurial_, Monotone_, Subversion_ and Tla_
[#]_ repositories.

This script makes it easier to keep the upstream changes merged in
a branch of a product, storing needed information such as the upstream
URI and revision in special properties on the branched directory.

The following ascii-art illustrates the usual scenario::

                           +------------+            +------------+
  +--------------+         | Immutable  |            | Working    |
  | Upstream CVS |-------->| darcs      |----------->| darcs      |
  | repository   | tailor  | repository | darcs pull | repository |
  +--------------+         +------------+            +------------+
                                                           |^         
                                                           ||
                                                           ||
                                                           v|
                                                          User

Ideally you should be able to swap and replace "CVS server" and "darcs
repository" with any combination of the supported systems.

A more convoluted setup shows how brave people are using it to get a
two way sync::

  +----------+        +--------+        +--------+       +---------+
  |          | -----> | hybrid | darcs  |        | ----> |   my    |
  | upstream | tailor |  CVS   | -----> | master | darcs | working |
  |   CVS    | <----- | darcs  | <----- | darcs  | <---- |  darcs  |
  |          |        |  sync  | tailor |        |       |         |
  +----------+        +--------+        +--------+       +---------+
               (cron)            (cron)


.. [#] ArX and Codeville systems may be used only as the `target`
       backend, since the `source` support isn't coded yet.
       Contributions on these backends will be very appreciated,
       since I do not use them enough to figure out the best way to
       get pending changes and build tailor ChangeSets out of them.

       To the opposite, Bazaar (1.0, not Bazaar-NG) and Tla are
       supported only as source systems.

Installation
============

tailor is written in Python, and thus Python must be installed on
your system to use it.  It has been successfully used with Python 2.3
and 2.4.

Since it relies on external tools to do the real work such as `cvs`,
`darcs` [#]_ and `svn`, they need to be installed as well, although only
those you will actually use.

Make tailor executable::

 $ chmod +x tailor

You can either run tailor where it is currently located, or move it
along with the vcpx directory to a location in your PATH.

There's even a standard setup.py that you may use to install the
script using Python's conventional distutils.

.. [#] Darcs 1.0.2 is too old, 1.0.3 is good, 1.0.4 (the fourth
       release candidate is under final testing) is recommended since
       it's faster in most operations!


Testing
=======

Tailor has more than 50 unit and operational tests, that you can
run with the following command line::

 $ tailor test -v

Since some tests take very long to complete, in particular the
operational tests, you may prefer the execution of a single suite::

 $ tailor test -v Darcs

or even a single test within a suite::

 $ tailor test StateFile.testJournal

To obtain a list of the test, use ``--list`` option.  As usual with::

 $ tailor test --help

you will get some more details.


Operation
=========

tailor needs now a configuration file that collects the various bits
of information it needs to do it's job.

The simplest way of starting out a new configuration is by omitting
the --configfile command line option, and specifying the other as
needed plus --verbose: in this situation, tailor will print out an
equivalent configuration that you can redirect to a file, that you
later will pass as --configfile.


Examples
--------

1. Bootstrap a new tailored project, starting at upstream revision 10

   a. First create a config file::
   
       $ tailor --verbose -s svn -R http://svn.server/path/to/svnrepo \
                --module /Product/trunk -r 10 --subdir Product \
                ~/darcs/MyProduct > myproject.tailor

   b. Modify it as you like (mostly adjusting root-directories and the
      like)::
      
       $ emacs myproject.tailor

   c. Run tailor on it::
   
       $ tailor --configfile myproject.tailor

2. Bootstrap a new product, fetching its whole CVS repository and
   storing under SVN

   a. First create a config file::

       $ tailor --verbose --source-kind cvs --target-kind svn \
                --repository :pserver:cvs.zope.org:/cvs-repository \
                --module CMF/CMFCore --revision INITIAL \
                --target-repository file:///some/where/svnrepo \
                --target-module / cmfcore > cmfcore.tailor

   b. Modify it as you like (mostly adjusting root-directories and the
      like)::

       $ emacs cmfcore.tailor

   .. note:: By default, tailor uses "." as ``subdir``, to mean that
             it will extract upstream source directly inside the
             ``root-directory``.

             This is known to cause problems with CVS as source, with
             which you could see some wierd error like

             ::

               $ cvs -q -d ...:/cvsroot/mymodule checkout -d . ... mymodule
               cvs checkout: existing repository /cvsroot/mymodule does not match /cvsroot/mymodule/mymodule
               cvs checkout: ignoring module mymodule

             When this is the case, the culprit may be a CVS
             shortcoming not being able to handle ``-d .`` in the
             right way.  Specify a different ``subdir`` option to
             avoid the problem.

   c. Run tailor on it once, to bootstrap the project::
   
       $ tailor -D -v --configfile cmfcore.tailor

      If the target repository is on the local filesystem (ie, it
      starts with ``file:///``) and it does not exist, tailor
      creates a new empty Subversion repository at the specified
      location.
      
   .. note:: Before step d) below, you may want to install an
             appropriate hook in the repository to enable the
             propset command to operate on unversioned properties,
             as described in the `svn manual`__. Then you can
             specify '--use-svn-propset' option, and tailor will
             put the original author and timestamp in the proper
             svn metadata instead of appending them to the changelog.

             Other than the annoying repository manual intervention,
             this thread__ and this other__ explain why using
             ``-r{DATE}`` may produce strange results with this setup.

   d. Run tailor again and again, to sync up with latest changes::

       $ tailor -D -v --configfile myproject.tailor
   
__ http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch05s02.html#svn-ch-5-sect-2.1
__ http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2005-07/0605.shtml
__ http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2005-03/0596.shtml


3. Given the configuration file shown below in `Config file format`_,
   the following command::

    $ tailor --configfile example.tailor

   is equivalent to this one::

    $ tailor --configfile example.tailor tailor

   in that they operate respectively on the default project(s) or
   the ones specified on the command line (and in this case there
   is just a single default project, tailor).

   This one instead::

    $ tailor --configfile example.tailor tailor tailor-reverse

   operates on both projects.


CVS start-revision
------------------

With CVS, you can specify a particular *point in time* specifying
a `start-revision` with a timestamp like ``2001-12-25 23:26:48 UTC``.

To specify also a particular `branch`, prepend it before the
timestamp, as in ``unstable-branch 2001-12-25 23:26:48 UTC``.

To migrate the whole history of a specific `branch`, use something
like ``somebranch INITIAL``.


Resolving conflicts
===================

Should one of the replayed changes generate any conflict, tailor
will prompt the user to correct them. This is done after the upstream
patch has been applied and before the final commit on the target
system, so that manually tweaking the conflict can produce a clean
patch.


Shortcomings
============

Tailor currently suffers of the following reported problems:

a) It does not handle "empty" CVS checkouts, in other words you cannot
   bootstrap a project that has nothing in its CVS upstream
   repository, or from a point in time where this condition was true.

b) It's completely unsupported under Windows, evenif it now uses
   2.4's subprocess_ that seems able to hide Windows crazyness...

c) ArX and Codeville are (currently) only supported as *target*;
   Bazaar and Tla only as *source*.

d) Specifying ``--subdir .`` may not work, in particular when dealing
   with remote CVS repositories (it does when the CVS repository is
   on local machine).
   
This list will always be incomplete, but I'll do my best to keep it
short :-)

Config file format
==================

When your project is composed by multiple upstream modules, it is
easier to collect such information in a single file. This is done by
specifying the `--configfile` option with a file name as argument. In
this case, tailor will read the above information from a standard
Python ConfigParser file.

For example::

    [DEFAULT]
    verbose = True
    projects = tailor

    [tailor]
    root-directory = /tmp/n9
    source = darcs:tailor
    target = svn:tailor
    state-file = tailor.state

    [tailor-reverse]
    root-directory = /tmp/n9
    source = svn:tailor
    target = darcs:tailor
    state-file = reverse.state
    
    [svn:tailor]
    repository = file:///tmp/testtai
    module = /project1
    subdir = svnside
    
    [darcs:tailor]
    repository = ~/WiP/cvsync
    subdir = darcside

The configuration may hold one or more `projects`_ and two or more
`repositories`_: project names do not contains colons ":",
repository names must and the first part of the name before the
colon specify the kind of the repository.  So, the above example
contains two projects, one that goes from `darcs` to `subversion`, the
other in the opposite direction.

The ``[DEFAULT]`` section contains the default values, that will be
used when a specific setting is missing from the particular section.

You can specify on which project tailor should operate by
giving its name on the command line, even more than one. When not
explicitly given, tailor will look at ``projects`` in the
``[DEFAULT]`` section, and if its missing it will loop over all
projects in the configuration.

The following simpler config just go in one direction, for a single
project, so no need neither for ``[DEFAULT].projects`` nor command
line arguments::

    [pxlib]
    source = cvs:pxlib
    target = hg:pxlib
    root-directory = ~/mypxlib
    start-revision = INITIAL
    subdir = pxlib
    
    [cvs:pxlib]
    repository = :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/pxlib
    module = pxlib

    [hg:pxlib]
    hg-command = /usr/local/bin/hg

This will use a single directory, ``pxlib`` to contain both the source
and the target system. If you prefer keeping the separated, you just
need to specify a different directory for each repository [#]_, as in::

    [pxlib]
    source = cvs:pxlib
    target = hg:pxlib
    root-directory = ~/mypxlib
    start-revision = INITIAL
    
    [cvs:pxlib]
    repository = :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/pxlib
    module = pxlib
    subdir = original
    delay-before-apply = 10

    [hg:pxlib]
    hg-command = /usr/local/bin/hg
    subdir = migrated

This will extract upstream CVS sources into ``~/mypxlib/original``,
and create a new Mercurial repository in ``~/mypxlib/migrated``.

On final example to show the syntax of Bazaar sources::

    [project]
    target = hg:target
    start-revision = base-0
    root-directory = /tmp/calife
    state-file = tailor.state
    source = baz:source

    [baz:source]
    module = calife--pam--3.0
    repository = roberto@keltia.net--2003-depot
    subdir = tla

    [hg:target]
    repository = /tmp/HG/calife-pam
    subdir = hg

.. [#] NB: when the source and the target repositories specify
       different directories with the ``subdir`` option, tailor
       uses ``rsync`` to keep them in sync, so that tool needs
       to be installed.


Configuration sections
----------------------

Default
~~~~~~~

The ``[DEFAULT]`` section in the configuration file may set the
default value for any of the recognized options: when a value is
missing from a specific section it is looked up in this section.

One particular option, ``projects``, is meaningful only in the
``[DEFAULT]`` section: it's a comma separated list of project names,
the one that will be operated on by tailor when no project is
specified on the command line.  When the there are no ``projects``
setting nor any on the command line, tailor activates all configured
projects, in order of appearance in the config file.


Projects
~~~~~~~~

A project is identified by a section whose name does not contain any
colon (":") character, and configured with the following values:

.. note:: If a particular option is missing from the project section,
          its value is obtained looking up the same option in the
          ``[DEFAULT]`` section.

root-directory : string
  This is where all the fun will happen: this directory will contain
  the source and the target working copy, and usually the state and
  the log file. It supports the conventional `~user` to indicate user's
  home directory and defaults to the current working directory.

subdir : string
  This is the subdirectory, relative to the `root-directory`, where
  tailor will extract the source working copy. It may be '.' for some
  backend kinds. The source and target backends will use this value
  if they don't explicitly override it.

state-file : string
  Name of the state file needed to store tailor last activity.

source : string
  The source repository: a repository name is something like
  "darcs:somename", that will be loaded from the homonymous section
  in the configuration.

target : string
  The counterpart of `source`, the repository that will receive the
  changes coming from there.

Non mandatory options:

verbose : bool
  Print the commands as they are executed.

debug : bool
  Print also their output.
  
before-commit : tuple
  This is a function name, or a sequence of function names enclosed
  by brackets, that will be executed on each changeset just before
  it get replayed on the target system: this may be used to perform
  any kind of alteration on the content of the changeset, or to skip
  some of them.

after-commit : tuple
  This is a function name, or a sequence of function names enclosed
  by brackets, that will be executed on each changeset just after
  the commit on the target system: this may be used for example to
  create a tag.

subdir : string
  The name of the subdirectory, under ``root-directory``, that will
  contain the source and target repositories/working directories.

start-revision : string
  This identifies from when tailor should start the migration. It can
  be either ``INITIAL``, to indicate the start of the history, or
  ``HEAD`` to indicate the current latest changeset, or a backend
  specific way of indicate a particular revision/tag in the history.
  See also `CVS start-revision`_ above.

patch-name-format : string
  Some backends have a distinct notion of `patch name` and `change
  log`, others just suggest a policy that the first line of the
  message is a summary, the rest if present is a more detailed
  description of the change.  With this option you can control the
  format of the name, or of the first line of the changelog.

  The prototype may contain ``%(keyword)s`` such as 'author', 'date',
  'revision', 'firstlogline', 'remaininglog' or 'project'.  It
  defaults to ``[%(project)s @ %(revision)s]``; setting it to the
  empty string means that tailor will simply use the original
  changelog.

  When you set it empty, as in

  ::

    [project]
    patch-name-format =

  tailor will keep the original changelog as is.

remove-first-log-line : bool
  Remove the first line of the upstream changelog. This is intended to
  go in pair with ``patch-name-format``, when using it's 'firstlogline'
  variable to build the name of the patch.  By default is ``False``.
  
  A reasonable usage is::

    [DEFAULT]
    patch-name-format=[%(project)s @ %(revision)s]: %(firstlogline)s
    remove-first-log-line=True

refill-changelogs : bool
  Off by default, when active tailor reformats every changelog before
  committing on the target system.


Repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the section whose name contains at least one colon character
denote a repository.  A single repository may be shared by zero, one or
more projects.  The first part of the name up to the first colon
indicates the `kind` of the repository, one of ``arx``, ``baz``, ``bzr``,
``cdv``, ``cvs``, ``darcs``, ``git``, ``hg``, ``hglib``, ``monotone``, 
``svn``, ``svndump`` and ``tla``.

.. note:: If a particular option is missing from the repository section,
          its value is obtained looking up the same option in the
          section of the project *currently* using the repository,
          falling back to the ``[DEFAULT]`` section.

repository : string
  When a repository is used as a `source`, it must indicate its origin
  with ``repository``, and for some backends also a ``module``, but
  are not required when it's a target system, even if some backend may
  use the information to create the target repository (like ``svn``
  backend does).

subdir : string
  When the `source` and `target` repositories use different
  subdirectories, tailor uses ``rsync`` to copy the changes between
  the two after each applied changeset.  When the source repository
  basedir is a subdirectory of target basedir tailor prefixes all
  paths coming from upstream to match the relative position.

  This defaults to the project's setting.

command : string
  Backends based on external command line tool such as *svn* or
  *darcs* offers this option to impose a particular external binary to
  be used, as done in the example above for ``hg``.

python-path : string
  For pythonique backends such as *bzr* and *hglib* this indicates
  where the respective library is located.

encoding : string
  States the charset encoding the particular repository uses, and it's
  particularly important when it differs from local system setup, that
  you may inspect executing::

    python -m locale

encoding-errors-policy : string
  By default is *strict*, that means that Python will raise an
  exception on Unicode conversion errors. Valid options are *ignore*
  that simply skips offending glyphs and *replace* where unrecognized
  entities are replaced with a place holder.

delay-before-apply : integer
  Sometime the migration is fast enough to put the upstream server
  under an excessive load. When this is the case, you may specify
  ``delay-before-apply = 5``, that is the number of seconds tailor
  will wait before applying each changeset.

  It defaults to *None*, ie no delay at all.

tag-entries : bool

look-for-adds : bool
  By default tailor commits only the entries explicitly mentioned by
  the upstream changeset. Sometimes this is not desiderable, maybe
  even as a quick workaround to a tailor bug. This option allows a
  more relaxed view of life using ``record --look-for-adds``.

keyid : string
  Monotone key id to use for commits. The specified key 
  must exist on keystore. Takes precedence
  over keyfile and keygenid.

keyfile : string
  File containing a keypair to store in the repository.
  The keypair is used for commits. Ignored if keyid is 
  specified.

keygenid : string
  Id of a new keypair to generate and store in the 
  repository.
  The keypair is used for commits. Ignored if keyid is 
  specified.

passphrase : string
  Passphrase to use for commits. Must be specified.

custom_lua : string
  Optional custom lua script. If present, is written into MT/monotonerc.

svn
%%%

filter-badchars : bool (or string)
  Activate (with *True*) or activate and specify (with a *string*) the
  filter on the svn log to eliminate illegal XML characters.

  *False* by default, when set to *True* the following characters are
  washed out from the upstream changes::

    allbadchars = "\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09" \
                  "\x0B\x0C\x0E\x0F\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15" \
                  "\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1A\x1B\x1C\x1D\x1E\x1F\x7f"

  If this is not right or enough, you can specify a string value
  instead of the boolean flag, containing the characters to omit, as
  in::

    filter-badchars=\x00\x01
  
use-propset : bool
  Indicate that tailor is allowed to properly inject the upstream
  changeset's author and timestamp into the target repository.  As
  stated above, this requires a manual intervention on the repository
  itself and thus is off by default, and tailor simply appends those
  values to the changelog.  When active at bootstrap time and the
  repository is local, tailor creates automatically a minimal
  ``hooks/pre-revprop-change`` script inside the repository, so no
  other intervention is needed. 

  *False* by default.

use-limit : bool
  By default *True*, should be set to *False* when using old
  Subversion clients, since ``log --limit`` was introduced with
  version 1.2. By using this option tailor can fetch just the
  revision it needs, instead of transfering whole history log.

trust-root : bool
  Tailor by default verifies that the specified ``repository``
  effectively points to the root of a Subversion repository,
  eventually splitting it and adjusting ``module`` accordingly.  This
  is sometimes undesiderable, for example when the root isn't public
  and cannot be listed.  Setting this option to *True* disable the
  check and tailor takes the given ``repository`` and ``module`` as-is.

ignore-externals : bool
  By default the Subversion backend does not consider the external
  references defined in the source repository.  This option force
  Tailor to behave as it did up to 0.9.20.

svndump
%%%%%%%

.. warning:: The svndump backend is totally wrong and almost unusable
             at this time, and will be replaced by a third party
             framework.

Using a Python script as configuration file
-------------------------------------------

Instead of executing ``tailor --configfile project.tailor.conf``
you can prepend the following signature to the config itself::

  #!/usr/bin/env /path/to/tailor

Giving execute mode to it will permit the launch of the tailor
process by running the config script directly::

  $ ./project.tailor.conf

When a config file is signed in this way [#]_, either you pass it as
argument to ``--configfile`` or executed as above, tailor will
actually execute it as a full fledged Python script, that may define
functions that alter the behaviour of tailor itself.

A common usage of this functionality is to define so called `hooks`,
sequences of functions that are executed at particular points in
the tailorization process.

Just to illustrate the functionality, consider the following example::

    #!/usr/bin/env tailor

    """
    [DEFAULT]
    debug = False
    verbose = True

    [project]
    target = bzr:target
    root-directory = /tmp/prova
    state-file = tailor.state
    source = darcs:source
    before-commit = before
    after-commit = after
    start-revision = Almost arbitrarily tagging this as version 0.8

    [bzr:target]
    python-path = /opt/src/bzr.dev
    subdir = bzrside

    [darcs:source]
    repository = /home/lele/WiP/cvsync
    subdir = darcside
    """

    def before(wd, changeset):
        print "BEFORE", changeset
        changeset.author = "LELE"
        return changeset

    def after(wd, changeset):
        print "AFTER", changeset

With the above in a `script` called say ``tester``, just doing::

    $ chmod 755 tester
    $ ./tester

will migrate the history from a darcs repository to a bazaar-ng one,
forcing the author to a well-known name :-)

.. [#] Tailor does actually read just the first two bytes from the
       file, and compare them with "#!", so you are free to choose
       whatever syntax works in your environment.


State file
----------

The state file stores two things: the last upstream revision that
has been applied to the tree, and a sequence of pending (not yet
applied) changesets, that may be empty. In the latter case, tailor
will fetch latest changes from the upstream repository.


Logging
-------

Tailor uses the Python's logging module to emit noise. It's basic
configuration is hardwired and correspond to the following::

    [formatters]
    keys = console

    [formatter_console]
    format =  %(asctime)s [%(levelname).1s] %(message)s
    datefmt = %H:%M:%S

    [loggers]
    keys = root

    [logger_root]
    level = INFO
    handlers = console

    [handlers]
    keys = console

    [handler_console]
    class = StreamHandler
    formatter = console
    args = (sys.stdout,)
    level = INFO

However, you can completely override the default adding a
*supersection* ``[[logging]]`` to the configuration file, something
like::

    # ... usual tailor config ...
    [project]
    source = bzr:source
    target = hg:target

    # Here ends tailor config, and start the one for the logging
    # module

    [[logging]]

    [logger_tailor.BzrRepository]
    level = DEBUG
    handlers = tailor.source

    [handler_tailor.source]
    class = SMTPHandler
    args = ('localhost', 'from@abc', ['tailor@abc'], 'Tailor log')

Further help
============

See the output of ``tailor -h`` for some further tips.  There's
also a `wiki page`_ that may give you some other hints.  The
development of Tailor is mainly driven by user requests at this point,
and the preferred comunication medium is the dedicated `mailing list`_
[#]_.

.. _wiki page:
   http://www.darcs.net/DarcsWiki/Tailor

.. _mailing list:
   http://lists.zooko.com/mailman/listinfo/tailor
   
I will be more than happy to answer any doubt, question or suggestion
you may have on it. I'm usually hanging out as "lelit" on the IRC
channel devoted to darcs on the `freenode.net` network. Do not
hesitate to contact me either by email or chatting there.

.. [#] I wish to say a big `Thank you` to `Zooko <zooko@zooko.com>`_,
       for hosting the ML and for supporting Tailor in several ways,
       from suggestions to bug reporting and fixing.

Since I'm not currently using all the supported systems (so little
time, so many VCSs...) I'm not in position to test them out properly,
but I'll do my best to keep them in sync, maybe with your support :-)
